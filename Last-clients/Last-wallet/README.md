# LAST-Wallet

## Description

⚠️ For internal testing only - not safe for production usage!

 ## 🛠 Setup

If you are in the last-mvp directory, navigate to the wallet directory using `cd LAST-wallet`. Run `npm install` to install dependancies required for the app to run.

Since the app is detached from expo, we must build manually using XCode and Android Studio. If you are running on a device and not a simulator, make sure that your device is connected to the same wifi as your computer.

### 📱 Running on iOS
1. Install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
2. Run `expo start --ios`
3. Open XCode, on build targets go to "last-wallet" -> General -> Check "Automatically manage signing"

4. Select a simulator with deployment target 9.0+ or select your device if connected
